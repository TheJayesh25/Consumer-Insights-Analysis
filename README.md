# Consumer-Insights-Analysis  

• This project is completed as part of the [Codebasics Project Challenge](https://codebasics.io/challenge/codebasics-resume-project-challenge)  
• The data source consists of three excel files called **fact_survey_responses** which consists of the responses to various questions regarding reasons, perceptions, preferences, choices, expectations, etc., **dim_respondents** which consists of information regarding various respondents such as name, age, gender, etc. and **dim_cities** which consists of information about city names, tiers, etc.  
#### NOTE: As part of this challenge, we were required to create a presentation to present the insights gained through the data analysis process. 
• Thus, the data was visualized using **Tableau** and the visualizations were used in the presentation.  
• The tool used for analysis was PostgreSQL.
